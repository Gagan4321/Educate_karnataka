            <h3><u>Diploma - Polytechnic</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A diploma is a certificate or academic qualification that is awarded by an educational institution, such as a college or university, to a student who has successfully completed a specific course of study. Diplomas can be awarded for a wide range of educational programs, from vocational and technical training to undergraduate and graduate studies.</li>
                <li>A diploma typically represents a level of academic achievement that is lower than a degree, but higher than a certificate or a high school diploma. Diploma programs may vary in length from a few months to several years, depending on the field of study and the level of education.</li>
                <li>Diploma programs are designed to provide students with practical knowledge and skills in a specific field, such as business, healthcare, engineering, or technology. They may include both classroom instruction and hands-on training, and may also require students to complete internships or apprenticeships in their chosen field.</li>
                <li>Diplomas can be used to enhance job prospects, advance careers, or provide a foundation for further academic study. They may also be recognized by professional associations or regulatory bodies in certain industries as a requirement for licensure or certification.
